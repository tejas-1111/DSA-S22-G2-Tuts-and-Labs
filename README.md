# DSA-S22-G2-Tuts-and-Labs
**Do not copy code from here (or anywhere from the internet) for assignments/projects**  
DSA is not just understanding the theory, but also being able to implement it.  

Contains material used for tuts and labs for group G2 during S22 DSA  
Src contains the codes for the (standard/basic) data structures and algorithms covered in the course  
Tuts contains the Pdfs and codes related to a specific tutorial  
Labs containts the Pdfs and codes related to a specific lab
